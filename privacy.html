		<h2 id="how-do-we-handle-your-social-logins">How Do We Handle Your Social Logins?</h2>

		<p><em><strong>In Short</strong>: If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</em>
		</p>

		<p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details
			(like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
			information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending
			on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and
			profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>

		<p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or
			that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are
			not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We
			recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your personal
			information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

		<p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em>
		</p>

		<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
			privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting,
			or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information
			for longer than 6 months.</p>

		<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
			or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
			has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it
			from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

		<h2 id="how-do-we-keep-your-information-safe">How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>

			technical security measures.*</p>

		<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to
			protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
			secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can
			be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
			unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
			modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
			personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services
			within a secure environment.</p>

			changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or
			by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be
			informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
